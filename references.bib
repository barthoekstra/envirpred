  abstract = {Abstract Motivation Birds are an extremely diverse group in terms of adaptations to environmental conditions, which is reflected in their life histories and ecological traits. Recently, functional aspects of avian diversity have been used frequently in comparative analyses as well as in community ecology studies; thus, open access to complete datasets of traits will be valuable. We focused on European bird species and compiled information about crucial ecological traits. This dataset is thus useful for research investigating large-scale patterns in European avifauna and can be used in various analyses in evolutionary ecology, macroecology or conservation biology. Main types of variables contained We chose several types of avian traits, such as morphological (e.g., weight, wing, bill or tarsus length), reproductive (e.g., clutch size, egg mass, incubation period or type of young) and behavioural traits (type of nest, mating system or type of parental care), dietary (e.g., folivore, granivore, insectivore or carnivore) and habitat preferences (e.g., deciduous/coniferous forest, reed or grassland). Spatial location and grain Europe; all breeding bird species (n = 499). Major taxa and level of measurement In total, we created a dataset for 499 bird species breeding in Europe and 34 key life-history traits represented in 85 variables. As a primary source of information we used the comprehensive handbook The birds of the Western Palearctic. The traits provide information about species-specific mean values. We did not record values for different geographical subspecies (i.e., the trait value always represents the average for the whole breeding area of a particular species). Software format The data file is in ASCII text, tab delimited, not compressed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The populations of many Afro-Palearctic migratory bird species have declined over the last 50 years, for reasons that remain poorly understood, but which could include major environmental changes in Africa. We mapped, for the first time, the aggregated population trends of migratory species onto their non-breeding distributions in sub-Saharan Africa and used regression models that account for non-stationarity to examine correlations between assemblage population trend indices and changes in climate and vegetation phenology over the same time period. This also allowed us to map geographical variation in these relationships across Africa. Our results revealed that relationships between population trends of migrant bird species and climate and phenology are spatially highly variable, and that there are no consistent, flyway-wide associations between climate or phenology and population trends. However, we found evidence that migrant population changes may be more closely linked to indices of vegetation senescence and climate than to indices of greening, suggesting further lines of investigation. Simply using cumulative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across Africa greatly underestimates the extent to which phenology and climate vary spatially, as do the relationships between population trends and these environmental variables. Furthermore, much better data on the nonbreeding ecology and distributions of migrants, including connectivity between breeding and wintering grounds, are needed if we are to assess with any confidence the extent to which they may be impacted by changes in environmental conditions in Africa. Until then, we suggest that there is no simple relationship between migrant populations and NDVI across species’ ranges, and that further studies should, at the very least, consider the multiple dimensions of phenology and the potential for spatial variation in relationships.},

abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a widely used tool and has many applications in ecology and conservation biology. Spatial autocorrelation (SAC), a pattern in which observations are related to one another by their geographic distance, is common in georeferenced ecological data. SAC in the residuals of SDMs violates the ‘independent errors’ assumption required to justify the use of statistical models in modelling species’ distributions. The autologistic modelling approach accounts for SAC by including an additional term (the autocovariate) representing the similarity between the value of the response variable at a location and neighbouring locations. However, autologistic models have been found to introduce bias in the estimation of parameters describing the influence of explanatory variables on habitat occupancy. To address this problem we developed an extension to the autologistic approach by calculating the autocovariate on SAC in residuals (the RAC approach). Performance of the new approach was tested on simulated data with a known spatial structure and on strongly autocorrelated mangrove species’ distribution data collected in northern Australia. The RAC approach was implemented as generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models. We found that the BRT models with only environmental explanatory variables can account for some SAC, but applying the standard autologistic or RAC approaches further reduced SAC in model residuals and substantially improved model predictive performance. The RAC approach showed stronger inferential performance than the standard autologistic approach, as parameter estimates were more accurate and statistically significant variables were accurately identified. The new RAC approach presented here has the potential to account for spatial autocorrelation while maintaining strong predictive and inferential performance, and can be implemented across a range of modelling approaches.},
