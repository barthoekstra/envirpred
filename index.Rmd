# Introduction {-}

## Reproducible analysis

Most of the analysis contained in this book can be reproduced by running the following function from the `bookdown` package. Some code chunks are set to `eval=FALSE` to avoid an extremely long-running knitting procedure, so it's best to run those manually when encountered.

```{r bookdown_code, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", new_session = TRUE)
```

It may be necessary to install some additional packages to make use of the `bs4_book` template for this book.

```{r bookdown_dependencies, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/bslib")
install.packages("downlit")
```
